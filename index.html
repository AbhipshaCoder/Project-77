        A console traditionally refers to a computer terminal where a user may input commands and
         view output such as the results of inputted commands or status messages from the computer. 
         In PC terms, the console no longer refers strictly to the monitor but to a piece of software,
          such as a command prompt, where a user can input advanced commands. This type of software is
           called a console because it is similar in function to the hardware console, which allows users
            advance use of the computer system it is attached to.

            <script>
            var first_console = "My First Console Project";
            console.log(first_console);

           var first_name = "Abhipsha";
           console.log(first_name);

           var last_name = "Datta";
           console.log(last_name);

           var fullname = first_name.concat(last_name);
           console.log(fullname);

           var squareroot = Math.sqrt(62);
           console.log(squareroot);

           var maximum_num = Math.max(89, 58, 62, 10);
           console.log(maximum_num);

           var power = Math.pow(9, 7);
           console.log(power);
